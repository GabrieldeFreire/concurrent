3.6 Barrier

Consider again the Rendezvous problem from Section 3.3.
A limitation of the solution we presented is that it does not work with more than two threads.

Puzzle: Generalize the rendezvous solution. Every thread should run the following code:

  Barrier code
 â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
1â”‚ rendezvous
2| critical point

The synchronization requirement is that no thread executes critical point until after all threads have executed rendezvous.
You can assume that there are n threads and that this value is stored in a variable, n, that is accessible from all threads.
When the first n âˆ’ 1 threads arrive they should block until the nth thread arrives, at which point all the threads may proceed.
